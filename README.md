# Opinions

Opinions. Get a daily dose of thought-provoking discussion and debate around controversial or intriguing questions. Engage and connect with others as you share your views and like others' responses.

## Inspiration

Inspired by social media apps like BeReal and Twitter. It is sort of a baby between the two, where we encourage thought-provoking conversation but keep interactions minimalist by establishing a single event where all users come together. We hope to help friends and users online to understand other's differing perspectives in this ever-growing world.

## What it does

The app releases an AI-generated "controversial" or thought-provoking question once-per-day. Users can then respond to said question, and also view other's responses and interact with them. Responses are currently anonymous, to encourage users to respond without fear of being ostracized.

## How we built it

Our front-end was first designed in Figma, and then later deployed via SwiftUI iOS. Our backend was written in Python to query OpenAI for the question prompts. Data is stored on Google Firebase securely and efficiently.

## Challenges we ran into

Apple's XCode had several dependency issues limiting our progress on the front end and later merging with the back end. It was some teammates' first experience with Cloud platforms, although, in the end, it all worked out.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of deploying a full-stack application capable of handling hundreds of users in which we could encourage conversation on interesting and unique topics.

## What we learned

We learned to use Cloud platforms like Firebase, prompting LLMs in OpenAI, and also new methods of UI/UX design.

## What's next for Opinions - A Question a Day

We plan to incorporate 2 forms, where users can have a "Friends" tab that includes responses from their friends, and another tab that is "Global", showing responses from all over the world. We also plan to include AI-formatted statistics in which users can see how they compare with their friends, others, and more.
